This project is for geotagging photos associated with monsoonal floods from New Delhiâ€™s Yamuna River. Local knowledge of New Delhi is useful for this project.

If you can only give a rough estimate of where a photo is, that is still valuable.

If it is not possible to geotag the photo, don't worry! Just click "I DON'T KNOW" as it is a valid and useful answer.
